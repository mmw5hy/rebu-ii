Requested that we make the top picture/search bar smaller on the hompeage smaller
User should be able to view by item and cook, chosen by toggle
Cooks don’t have a store name - remove this field from models
Good map wireframe - don’t have it take up the whole page
Put reviews into the item page since its no longer a cook page
Message conversations should be saved, need to make models for this
User can only order from one cook per order
Drop down for choosing cuisines when cook adds an item; add serving size to item
Add plus and subtract buttons to order page when specifying quantity
User should be able to type specific comments when placing an order
