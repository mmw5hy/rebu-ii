Ben: We want to create only one stage that says if you were registered than a email was sent to you about password reset.
(He showed all of the password change stuff, great job). 

Ani - multiple addresses 


Grant - Have prepopulated profile editing 

Arun - change available items to available dishes.


Dor - Desired tasks and ‘bug’s. Shopping cart with bugs. 


Ani / Varun - if they change their address, there’s a pop up that says new locations are removed and added because of address change within 15 miles or whatever
