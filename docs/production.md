Steps Required to Get Production Server to work

1) Initialize a GitHub repository on the server so that our work is transferred on the production server.

2) Pull the repo, using my credentials

3) Using the steps for Project 2, get the server ready to host, as well as changing the settings of the project to work on the server

4) Take care of all the required migrations for the Django project

5) Start a tmux session that can stay running even if my laptop is closed or I am logged out of the server

6) Run the command given to start the server. "python manage.py runserver 10.1.1.###:8000"

7) Exit the tmux session and logout of the server

8) You're done! Check http://128.143.71.210:28### to make sure that your website is live and running.
